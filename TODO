Optimizations:
- use CryptoJS version 3 instead of 2.5 (need to figure out how to use AES correctly)
- use external repositories when possible (jQuery, CryproJS)
- use https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/ to compress js (should not yield much space because amount of internal js compared to external is reaaaaly small)

Features:
- add some validation for DB and include/
- make 'enter' work in login with token dialog
- add AES input vector support

Noncritical features:
- add .cryptoboxrc support

Someday:
- simplify usage of token based authentication (maybe find another way around this crappy forms?!)
