Optimizations:
- use http://jqueryui.com/download to build distribution with only required components
- use CryptoJS version 3 instead of 2.5 (need to figure out how to use AES correctly)
- use external repositories when possible (jQuery, CryproJS)
- use https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/ to compress js

Features:
- add support for HERE DOCUMENT in the db (to be possible to enter multiline values)
- add lock timeout (and make it configurable via cfg.py)

Noncritical features:
- add .cryptoboxrc support

Someday:
- simplify usage of token based authentication (maybe find another way around this crappy forms?!)
