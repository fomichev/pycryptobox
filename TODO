Optimizations:
- use external repositories when possible (jQuery, CryproJS)
- use https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/ to compress js (should not yield much space because amount of internal js compared to external is reaaaaly small) - try POST request to compress JS and if failed, use non-optimized

Features:
- add some validation for DB and include/
- generate salt and iv upon database creation

Noncritical features:
- add .cryptoboxrc support

Someday:
- simplify usage of token based authentication (maybe find another way around this crappy forms?!)
