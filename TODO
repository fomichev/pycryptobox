Optimizations:
- use external repositories when possible (jQuery, CryproJS) to keep up with
  updates
- use https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/ to compress js (should
  not yield much space because amount of internal js compared to external is
  reaaaaly small) - try POST request to compress JS and if failed, use
  non-optimized

Bugfixes:
- generate json only once to make 'WARNING! Not found entry type' appear only
  once

Features:
- add chrome extension (https://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html) which may be used in the developer mode
- add some validation for DB and include/
- add support for aliases (alias=login/xyz login/qwe login/asd - will generate
  3 additional entries in HTML)
- generate new salt and iv on password change?
- add setup.py (easy_install or pip)
- improve autolock feature (don't use mouse move event)
- revise README.me and add other missing information

Low priority:
- fix form bookmarklet for deviantart.com, lastpass.com
- add support for @token in form.action
- add comments to all items under include/ describing required variables

Extern:
- update CryptoJS to 3.0.2
