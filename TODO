Optimizations:
- use external repositories when possible (jQuery, CryproJS) to keep up with
  updates
- use https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/ to compress js (should
  not yield much space because amount of internal js compared to external is
  reaaaaly small) - try POST request to compress JS and if failed, use
  non-optimized

Features:
- add hidden=yes feature to hide unused login entries from HTML
- add favorites feature (place favorites on a distinct page)
- fix backup (absolute paths; should be relative)
- add some validation for DB and include/
- add light version (l.cryptobox.html) which should not include any js (jquery,
  etc) besides crypto stuff
- add support for broken logins (add broken field) - don't allow one-click login
  and rename to something more clear
- add support for aliases (alias=login/xyz login/qwe login/asd - will generate
  3 additional entries in HTML)
- generate new salt and iv on password change?
- add setup.py (easy_install or pip)
- add support for @token in form.action - low prio
- improve autolock feature (don't use mouse move event)
- update 'Decrypt data without cryptobox' in README.md (convert example to INI)
  revise README.me and add other missing information
- add identity include (name, address, phone, etc)
- fix form bookmarklet for deviantart.com

Someday:
- add some way (tool?) to explore include/ directory - some thing that will
  help user to understand which variables are required for particular entry type
