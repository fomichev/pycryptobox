Optimizations:
- use external repositories when possible (jQuery, CryproJS)
- use https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/ to compress js (should
  not yield much space because amount of internal js compared to external is
  reaaaaly small) - try POST request to compress JS and if failed, use non-optimized

Features:
- use init file for configuration
- add some validation for DB and include/
- add light version (l.cryptobox.html) which should not include any js (jquery,
  etc) besides crypto stuff
- check whether we still (because of new cryptojs version) need to add padding
  to json in flatten.py
- add some way (tool?) to explore include/ directory - some thing that will
  help user to understand which variables are required for particular entry type

Noncritical features:
- add .cryptoboxrc support

Someday:
- simplify usage of token based authentication (maybe find another way around
  this crappy forms?!)
